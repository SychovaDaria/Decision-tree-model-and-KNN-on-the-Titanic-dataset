Creating a decision tree model and KNN on the Titanic dataset
In this project, I used the titanic dataset to create a decision tree model and KNN. I connected to the data, processed it, created and trained two models, and customized their hyperparameters. Then I selected the best model using F1 score and AUC curve. I checked the accuracy of the final model on the test dataset
